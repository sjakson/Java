// Life.java
//
// Simulates the Game of Life, in which a colony of organisms reproduces
// according to rules relating to the distribution of organisms.

// The organisms live in the cells of a rectangular grid. Thus, a given
// organism has at most 8 neighbors.  Each organism is either living or dead.

// In any given generation, an organism dies if it has fewer than 2
// neighbors (death from exposure) or more than 3 neighbors (death from
// overcrowding).  An organism is born in an empty cell if there are
// exactly 3 neighboring cells that contain live organisms.  Births and
// deaths are supposed to occur simultaneously.  Therefore, the status
// of the cells in any generation depends only on the status of cells
// in the previous generation.

// We use objects to represent each cell and the entire colony of cells.

// Prints the display graphically.
